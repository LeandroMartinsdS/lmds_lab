# lab_lmds

This repository serves as a sandbox for prototyping, experimenting, and testing ideas. It acts as a staging ground where concepts and tools can be explored in a flexible and informal environment.

> **Note**: If any component or idea proves useful or grows in scope, it may eventually be moved to its own dedicated repository.

## Purpose

The goal of `lab_lmds` is to:
- Rapidly prototype ideas
- Test small utilities, modules, or algorithms
- Serve as a scratchpad for development experiments
- Provide a low-friction space for creative exploration

## Structure

This repo does not follow a strict structure. Expect:
- Isolated scripts or modules
- Incomplete or evolving code
- Occasional notes, todos, or documentation stubs

The organization may change over time as ideas mature or are discarded.

## Naming Convention

Files, folders, and commits may be loosely named or annotated with experimental context. More formal structure will be applied only if the code is promoted to its own repo.

## License

This project is released under the MIT License. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
